# GetBetterSleep
Repository for a minecraft plugin that lets players skip the night by voting with commands or by sleeping in a bed.
With this vote system, a vote can only start if it is night time, this is the first attempt to skip the night.
The vote progress, such as time left, how many votes for yes and no, are all displayed across the top like a boss bar. 
Players in the nether or end, cannot vote as sleeping does not affect them.


Commands:
/sleep yes - starts a vote or adds a yes to the current vote
/sleep no - votes no
/sleep benefits - Lists benefits for voting with a bed
/sleep help - displays commands ingame
/sleep debug - toggles the debug mode.

Benefits:
While commands can skip night, voting to skip night with a bed has extra benefits.
1 in 5 chance of getting a phantom membrane.
1 in 5 chance of getting Prismarine Crystal.
1 in 5 chance of getting healed.
